< hey  love.  Our  world  is  rapidly 
< drawing  to  a  close  ;  a  new  one  is  about  to  open.  If  it  is  to  flourish 
< it  will  have  to  rest  on  deeds  as  well  as  faith.  The  word  will  have  to 
< become  flesh. 
< 
< There  are  few  among  us  today  who  are  able  to  view  the  immediate 
< future  with  anything  but  fear  and  apprehension.  If  there  is  one  book 
< among  all  those  I  have  recendy  read  which  I  might  signal  as  con- 
< taining words  of  comfort,  peace,  inspiration  and  sublimity,  it  is 
< Henry  Adams'  Mont-Saint-Michel  and  Chartrfs.  Particularly  the 
< chapters  dealing  with  Chartres  and  the  cult  of  the  Virgin  Mary. 
< Every  reference  to  the  "  Queen  **  is  exalted  and  commanding.  Let 
< me  quote  a  passage — page  194* — which  is  in  order  : 
< 
< There  she  acttially  is — ^not  in  symbol  or  in  fancy,  but  in 
< penon,  descending  on  her  errands  of  mercy  and  listening 
< to  each  one  of  us,  as  her  miracles  prove,  or  satisfying  our 
< prayers  merely  by  her  presence  which  calms  our  excite- 
< ment as  that  of  a  mother  calms  her  child.  She  is  there  as 
< Queen,  not  merely  as  intercessor,  and  her  power  is  such 
< that  to  her  the  difierence  between  us  earthly  beings  is 
< nothing.  Pierre  Mauclerc  and  PhiHppe  Hurepel  and  their 
< men-at-arms  are  afraid  of  her,  and  the  Bishop  himself  is 
< never  quite  at  his  ease  in  her  presence  ;  but  to  peasants, 
< and  beggars,  and  people  in  trouble,  this  sense  of  her  power 
< and  caJm  is  better  than  active  sympathy.  People  who 
< sufi*er  beyond  the  formulas  of  expression — ^who  are  crushed 
< into  silence,  and  beyond  pain — ^want  no  display  of  emotion 
< — ^no  bleeding  heart — ^no  weeping  at  the  foot  of  the  Cross 
< — ^no  hysterics — ^no  phrases  !  They  want  to  see  God,  and  to 
< know  that  He  is  watching  over  His  own. 
< 
< There  are  writers,  such  as  this  man,  who  enrich  us — and  others 
< who  impoverish  us.  However  it  be,  there  is  all  the  while  a  more 
< important  thing  going  on.  All  the  while,  whether  we  enrich  or 
< impoverish,  we  who  write,  we  authors,  we  men  of  letters,  we 
< scribblers,  are  being  supported,  protected,  maintained,  enriched 
< and  endowed  by  a  vast  horde  of  unknown  individuals — the  men 
< and  women  who  watch  and  pray,  so  to  speak,  that  we  reveal  the 
< truth  which  is  in  us.  How  vast  this  multitude  is  no  man  knows.

< THEY  WERE  ALIVE  AND  THEY  SPOKE  TO  ME 
< 
< I  SIT  in  a  little  room,  one  wall  of  which  is  now  completely  lined 
< with  books.  It  is  the  first  time  I  have  had  the  pleasure  of  working 
< with  anything  like  a  collection  of  books.  There  are  probably  no 
< more  than  five  hundred  in  all,  but  for  the  most  part  they  represent 
< my  own  choice.  It  is  the  first  time,  since  I  began  my  writing  career, 
< that  I  am  surrounded  with  a  goodly  number  of  the  books  I  have 
< always  longed  to  possess.  The  fact,  however,  that  in  the  past  I 
< did  most  of  my  work  without  the  aid  of  a  Hbrary  I  look  upon  as 
< an  advantage  rather  than  a  disadvantage. 
< 
< One  of  the  first  things  I  associate  with  the  reading  of  books  is 
< the  struggle  I  waged  to  obtain  them.  Not  to  own  them,  mind  you, 
< but  to  lay  hands  on  them.  From  the  moment  the  passion  took 
< hold  of  me  I  encountered  nothing  but  obstacles.  The  books  I 
< wanted,  at  the  pubUc  Hbrary,  were  always  out.  And  of  course  I 
< never  had  the  money  to  buy  them.  To  get  permission  from  the 
< Hbrary  in  my  neighborhood — I  was  then  eighteen  or  nineteen 
< years  of  age— to  borrow  such  a  **  demoralizing  "  work  as  The 
< Confession  of  a  Fool,  by  Strindberg,  was  just  impossible.  In  those 
< days  the  books  which  young  people  were  prohibited  from  reading 
< were  decorated  with  stars — one,  two  or  three — according  to  the 
< degree  of  immoraHty  attributed  to  them.  I  suspect  this  procedure 
< still  obtains.  I  hope  so,  for  I  know  of  nothing  better  calculated  to 
< whet  one's  appetite  than  this  stupid  sort  of  classification  and 
< prohibition. 
< 
< What  makes  a  book  live  ?  How  often  this  question  arises  !  The 
< answer,  in  my  opinion,  is  simple.  A  book  Hves  through  the  pas- 
< sionate recommendation  of  one  reader  to  another.  Nothing  can 
< throttle  this  basic  impulse  in  the  human  being.  Despite  the  views 
< of  cynics  and  misanthropes,  it  is  my  beHef  that  men  will  always 
< strive  to  share  their  deepest  experiences. 
< 
< Books  are  one  of  the  few  things  incn  cherish  deeply.  And  the 
< 32

< 
< better  the  man  the  more  easily  will  he  part  with  his  most  cherished 
< possessions.  A  book  lying  idle  on  a  shelf  is  wasted  ammunirion. 
< Like  money,  books  must  be  kept  in  constant  circulation.  Lend 
< and  borrow  to  the  maximum — of  both  books  and  money  !  But 
< especially  books,  for  books  represent  infinitely  more  than  money. 
< A  book  is  not  only  a  fiiend,  it  makes  friends  for  you.  When  you 
< have  possessed  a  book  with  mind  and  spirit,  you  are  enriched. 
< But  when  you  pass  it  on  you  are  enriched  threefold. 
< 
< Here  an  irrepressible  impulse  seizes  me  to  offer  a  piece  of 
< gratuitous  advice.  It  is  this :  read  as  Uttle  as  possible,  not  as  much 
< as  possible  !  Oh,  do  not  doubt  that  I  have  envied  those  who  drowned 
< themselves  in  books.  I,  too,  would  secretly  Hke  to  wade  through 
< all  those  books  I  have  so  long  toyed  with  in  my  mind.  But  I  know 
< it  is  not  important.  I  know  now  that  I  did  not  need  to  read  even 
< a  tenth  of  what  I  have  read.  The  most  difficult  thing  in  Ufe  is  to 
< learn  to  do  only  what  is  strictly  advantageous  to  one's  welfare, 
< strictly  vital. 
< 
< There  is  an  excellent  way  to  test  this  precious  bit  of  advice  I  have 
< not  given  rashly.  When  you  stumble  upon  a  book  you  would 
< like  to  read,  or  think  you  ought  to  read,  leave  it  alone  for  a  few 
< days.  But  think  about  it  as  intensely  as  you  can.  Let  the  title  and 
< the  author's  name  revolve  in  your  mind.  Think  what  you  yourself 
< might  have  written  had  the  opportunity  been  yours.  Ask  yourself 
< earnestly  if  it  be  absolutely  necessary  to  add  this  work  to  your 
< store  of  knowledge  or  your  fund  of  enjoyment.  Try  to  imagine 
< what  it  would  mean  to  forego  this  extra  pleasure  or  erdightenment. 
< Then,  if  you  find  you  must  read  the  book,  observe  with  what 
< extraordinary  acumen  you  tackle  it.  Observe,  too,  that  however 
< stimulating  it  may  be,  very  Httle  of  the  book  is  really  new  to  you. 
< If  you  are  honest  with  yourself  you  will  discover  that  your  stature 
< has  increased  from  the  mere  effort  of  resisting  your  impulses. 
< 
< Indubitably  the  vast  majority  of  books  overlap  one  another. 
< Few  indeed  are  those  which  give  the  impression  of  originality, 
< either  in  style  or  content.  Rare  are  the  unique  books — ^less  than 
< fifiy,  perhaps,  out  of  the  whole  storehouse  of  Hterature.  In  one  of 
< his  recent  autobiographical  novels,  Blaise  Cendrars  points  out 
< that  R^my  de  Gourmont,  because  of  his  knowledge  and  awareness 
< of  this  repetitive  quaUty  in  books,  was  able  to  select  and  read  all 
< 
< 23 
< 
< 
< THE    BOOKS    IN    MY    LIFE 
< 
< that  is  worth  while  in  the  entire  reahn  of  literature,  Cendrars 
< himself— who  would  suspect  it  ?— is  a  prodigious  reader.  He  reads 
< most  authors  in  their  original  tongue.  Not  only  that,  but  when 
< he  Ukes  an  author  he  reads  every  last  book  the  man  has  written, 
< as  well  as  his  letters  and  all  the  books  that  have  been  written  about 
< him.  In  our  day  his  case  is  almost  unparalleled,  I  imagine.  For, 
< not  only  has  he  read  widely  and  deeply,  but  he  has  himself  written 
< a  great  many  books.  All  on  the  side,  as  it  were.  For,  if  he  is  any- 
< thing, Cendrars,  he  is  a  man  of  action,  an  adventurer  and  explorer, 
< a  man  who  has  known  how  to  "waste**  his  time  royally.  He 
< is,  in  a  sense,  the  JuHus  Caesar  of  Hterature. 
< 
< The  other  day,  at  the  request  of  the  French  publisher,  Gallimard, 
< I  made  up  a  Hst  of  the  hundred  books*  which  I  thought  had 
< influenced  me  most.  A  strange  list,  indeed,  containing  such  incon- 
< gruous titles  as  Peck*s  Bad  Boy,  Letters  from  the  Mahatmas  and  Pitcaim 
< Island.  The  first  named,  a  decidedly  "  bad  "  book,  I  read  as  a  boy. 
< I  thought  it  worth  including  in  my  list  because  no  other  book 
< ever  made  me  laugh  so  heartily.  Later,  in  my  teens,  I  made  periodical 
< trips  to  the  local  hbrary  to  paw  the  books  on  the  shelf  labelled 
< "  Humor.**  How  few  I  found  which  were  really  humorous  ! 
< This  is  the  one  realm  of  Uterature  which  is  woefully  meagre  and 
< deficient.  After  citing  Huckleberry  Finn,  The  Crock  of  Gold,  Lysis- 
< trata.  Dead  Souls,  two  or  three  of  Chesterton's  works,  and  Juno 
< and  the  Paycock,  I  am  hard  put  to  it  to  mention  anything  outstanding 
< in  this  category  of  humor.  There  are  passages  in  Dostoievsky  and 
< in  Hamsun,  it  is  true,  which  still  bring  tean  of  laughter  to  my  eyes, 
< but  they  are  only  passages.  The  professional  humorists,  and  their 
< names  are  legion,  bore  me  to  death.  Books  on  humor,  such  as 
< Max  Eastman*s,  Arthur  Koestler*s,  or  Bergson's,  I  also  find  deadly. 
< It  would  be  an  achievement,  I  feel,  if  I  could  write  just  one  humorous 
< book  before  I  die.  The  Chinese,  incidentally,  possess  a  sense  of 
< humor  which  is  very  close,  very  dear,  to  me.  Particularly  their 
< poets  and  philosophers. 
< 
< In  books  for  children,  which  influence  us  the  most— I  mean 
< fiiiry  tales,  legends,  myths,  allegories— humor  is,  of  course,  woefully 
< absent.  Horror  and  tragedy,  lust  and  cruelty,  seem  to  be  the  cardinal 
< ingredients.    But  it  is  through  the  reading  of  these  boob  that  the

< imaginative  faculty  is  nourisheci.  As  we  grow  older,  fantasy  and 
< imagination  become  increasingly  rare  to  find.  One  is  carried  along 
< on  a  treadmill  which  grows  increasingly  monotonous.  The  mind 
< becomes  so  dulled  that  it  takes  a  truly  extraordinary  book  to  rout 
< one  out  of  a  state  of  indifference  or  apathy. 
< 
< With  childhood  reading  there  is  a  factor  of  significance  which  we 
< arc  prone  to  forget — the  physical  ambiance  of  the  occasion.  How 
< distinctly,  in  after  years,  one  remembers  the  feel  of  a  favorite  book, 
< the  typography,  the  binding,  the  illustrations,  and  so  on.  How  easily 
< one  can  locaHze  the  time  and  place  of  a  first  reading.  Some  books 
< are  associated  with  illness,  some  with  bad  weather,  some  with 
< punishment,  some  with  reward.  In  the  remembrance  of  these 
< events  the  inner  and  outer  worlds  fiise.  These  readings  are  distinctly 
< "  events  "  in  one's  life. 
< 
< There  is  one  thing,  moreover,  which  differentiates  the  reading 
< done  in  childhood  firom  later  reading,  and  that  is  the  absence  of 
< choice.  The  books  one  reads  as  a  child  arc  thrust  upon  one.  Lucky 
< the  child  who  has  wise  parents  !  So  powerful,  however,  is  the 
< dominion  of  certain  books  that  even  the  ignorant  parent  can  hardly 
< avoid  them.  What  child  has  not  read  Sinhad  the  Sailor,  Jason  and 
< the  Golden  Fleece,  All  Baba  and  the  Forty  Thieves,  the  Fairy  Tales 
< of  Grimm  and  Andersen,  Robinson  Crusoe,  Gulliver's  Travels  and 
< such  like  i 
< 
< Who  also,  I  ask,  has  not  enjoyed  the  uncanny  thrill  which  comes 
< later  in  life  on  rereading  his  early  favorites  ?  Only  recently,  after 
< the  lapse  of  almost  fifty  years,  I  reread  Henty's  Lion  of  the  North. 
< What  an  experience  !  As  a  boy,  Henty  was  my  favorite  author. 
< Every  Christmas  my  parents  would  give  me  eight  or  ten  of  his 
< books.  I  must  have  read  every  blessed  one  before  I  was  fourteen. 
< Today,  and  I  regard  this  as  phenomenal,  I  can  pick  up  any  book 
< of  his  and  get  the  same  fascinating  pleasure  I  got  as  a  boy. 
< He  does  not  seem  to  be  **  talking  down  "  to  his  reader.  He  seems, 
< rather,  to  be  on  intimate  terms  with  him.  Everyone  knows,  I 
< presume,  that  Henty*s  books  arc  historical  romances.  To  the  lads 
< of  my  day  they  were  vitally  important,  because  they  gave  us  our 
< first  perspective  of  world  history.  The  Lion  of  the  North,  for  instance, 
< is  about  Gustavus  Adolphus  and  the  Thirty  Years*  War.  In  it 
< appears  that  strange,  enigmatic  figure— Wallenstein.     When,  just 
< 
< 25 
< 
< 
< The   books   in   my   lif£ 
< 
< the  other  day,  I  came  upon  the  pages  dealing  with  Wallenstein, 
< it  was  as  though  I  had  read  them  only  a  few  months  ago.  As  I 
< remarked  in  a  letter  to  a  friend,  after  closing  the  book,  it  was  in 
< these  pages  about  Wallenstein  that  I  first  encountered  the  words 
< "  destiny  *'  and  "  astrology."  Pregnant  words,  for  a  boy.  at  any 
< rate. 
< 
< I  began  by  speaking  of  my  "  hbrary."  Only  lately  I  had  the 
< pleasure  of  reading  about  the  Hfe  and  times  of  Montaigne.  Like 
< ours,  his  was  an  age  of  intolerance,  persecution,  and  wholesale 
< massacres.  I  had  often  heard,  to  be  sure,  of  Montaigne's  withdrawal 
< from  active  Hfe,  of  his  devotion  to  books,  of  his  quiet,  sober  life, 
< so  rich  in  inward  ways.  There,  of  course,  was  a  man  who  could 
< be  said  to  possess  a  Hbrary  !  For  a  moment  I  envied  him.  If,  I 
< thought  to  myself,  I  could  have  in  this  Uttle  room,  right  at  my 
< elbow,  all  the  books  which  I  cherished  as  a  child,  a  boy,  a  young 
< man,  how  fortunate  I  would  be  !  It  was  always  my  habit  to  mark 
< excessively  the  books  I  liked.  How  wonderful  it  would  be,  thought 
< I,  to  see  those  markings  again,  to  know  what  were  my  opinions 
< and  reactions  in  that  long  ago.  I  thought  of  Arnold  Bennett,  of 
< the  excellent  habit  he  had  formed  of  inserting  at  the  back  of  every 
< book  he  read  a  few  blank  pages  whereon  he  might  record  his  notes 
< and  impressions  as  he  went  along.  One  is  always  curious  to  know 
< what  one  was  like,  how  one  behaved,  how  one  reacted  to  thoughts 
< and  events,  at  various  periods  in  the  past.  In  the  marginal  annota- 
< tions of  books  one  can  easily  discover  one's  former  selves. 
< 
< When  one  realizes  the  tremendous  evolution  of  one's  being  which 
< occurs  in  a  lifetime  one  is  bound  to  ask  :  "  Does  life  cease  vwth 
< bodily  death  i  Have  I  not  Hved  before  ?  Will  I  not  appear  again 
< on  earth  or  perhaps  on  some  other  planet  i  Am  I  not  truly  imperish- 
< able, as  is  all  else  in  the  universe  t "  Perhaps,  too,  one  may  be 
< impelled  to  ask  himself  a  still  more  important  question  :  "  Did  I 
< learn  my  lesson  liere  on  earth  ?  " 
< 
< Montaigne,  I  noticed  with  pleasure,  speaks  frequently  of  his 
< bad  memory.  He  says  that  he  was  unable  to  recall  the  contents, 
< or  even  his  impressions,  of  certain  books,  many  of  which  he  had 
< read  not  once  but  several  times.  I  feel  certain,  however,  that  he 
< must  have  had  a  good  memory  in  other  respects.  Most  everyone 
< has  a  faulty,  spotty  memory.  The  men  who  can  quote  copiously 
< 26  /

< and  accurately  from  the  thousands  of  books  they  have  read,  who 
< can  relate  the  plot  of  a  novel  in  detail,  who  can  give  names  and 
< dates  of  historical  events,  and  so  on,  possess  a  monstrous  sort  of 
< memory  which  has  always  seemed  repellent  to  me.  I  am  one  of 
< those  who  have  a  weak  memory  in  certain  respects  and  a  strong 
< one  in  others.  In  short,  just  the  kind  of  memory  which  is  useful 
< for  me.  When  I  really  wish  to  recall  something  I  can,  though  it 
< may  take  considerable  time  and  effort.  I  know  quietly  that  nothing 
< is  lost.  But  I  know  also  that  it  is  important  to  cultivate  a  "  forget- 
< tery."  The  flavor,  the  savor,  the  aroma,  the  ambiance,  as  well 
< as  the  value  or  non-value  of  a  thing,  I  never  forget.  The  only  kind 
< of  memory  I  wish  to  preserve  is  the  Proustian  sort.  To  know  that 
< there  is  this  infaUible,  total,  exact  memory  is  sufficient  for  me. 
< How  often  it  happens  that,  in  glancing  through  a  book  read  long 
< ago,  one  stimibles  on  passages  whose  every  word  has  a  burning, 
< inexhaustible,  unforgettable  resonance  i    Recently,  in  completing  y 
< 
< the  script  of  the  second  book  of  The  Rosy  Crucifixion,  I  was  obHged 
< to  turn  to  my  notes,  made  many  years  ago,  on  Spengler's  Declitt^^ 
< of  the  West.  There  were  certain  passages,  a  considerable  number, 
< I  might  say,  of  which  I  had  only  to  read  the  opening  words  and 
< the  rest  followed  Hke  music.  The  sense  of  the  words  had  lost,  in 
< some  instances,  some  of  the  importance  I  once  attached  to  them, 
< but  not  the  words  themselves.  Every  time  I  struck  these  passages, 
< for  I  had  read  them  again  and  again,  the  language  became  more 
< redolent,  more  pregnant,  more  charged  with  that  mysterious 
< quality  which  every  great  author  embeds  in  his  language  and  which 
< is  the  mark  of  his  uniqueness.  At  any  rate,  so  impressed  was  I  by 
< the  vitality  and  hypnotic  character  of  these  Spenglerian  passages 
< that  I  decided  to  quote  a  number  of  them  in  their  entirety.  It  was 
< an  experiment  which  I  felt  obHged  to  conduct,  an  experiment 
< between  myself  and  my  readers.  The  lines  I  chose  to  quote  had 
< become  my  very  own  and  I  felt  that  they  had  to  be  transmitted. 
< Were  they  not  every  bit  as  important  in  my  Hfe  as  the  haphazard 
< encounters,  crises  and  events  which  I  had  described  as  my  own  ?

< I  spend  whole  days  trying  to  recollect  where  I  have  secreted  them. 
< Thus,  the  other  day,  opening  one  of  my  Paris  notebooks  to  look 
< for  something  else,  I  stimibled  on  one  of  those  passages  which  have 
< hved  with  me  for  years.  It  is  by  Gautier  from  Havelock  Ellis*  Intro- 
< duction to  Against  the  Grain.  It  begins  :  "  The  poet  of  the  Fleurs 
< du  Mai  loved  what  is  improperly  called  the  style  of  decadence, 
< and  which  is. nothing  else  but  art  arrived  at  that  point  of  extreme 
< maturity  yielded  by  the  slanting  suns  of  aged  civilizations :  an 
< ingenious,  compHcated  style,  full  of  shades  and  of  research,  con- 
< stantly pushing  back  the  boundaries  of  speech,  borrowing  from 
< all  the  technical  vocabularies,  taking  color  from  all  palettes  and 
< notes  from  all  keyboards  ..."  Then  follows  a  sentence  which 
< always  pops  up  Hke  a  flashing  semaphore  :  "  The  style  of  decadence 
< is  the  ultimate  utterance  of  the  Word,  summoned  to  final  expression 
< and  driven  to  its  last  hiding-place." 
< 
< Utterances  such  as  these  I  have  often  copied  out  in  large  letters 
< and  placed  above  my  door  so  that,  in  leaving,  my  friends  would 
< be  sure  to  read  them.  Some  people  have  the  opposite  compulsion 
< — they  keep  these  precious  revelations  secret.  My  weakness  is  to 
< shout  from  the  rooftop  whenever  I  beHeve  I  have  discovered  some- 
< thing of  vital  importance.  On  finishing  a  wonderfril  book,  for 
< example,  I  almost  always  sit  down  and  write  letters  to  my  friends, 
< sometimes  to  the  author,  and  occasionally  to  the  publisher.  The 
< experience  becomes  a  part  of  my  daily  conversation,  enters  into  the 
< very  food  and  drink  I  consume.  I  called  this  a  weakness.  Perhaps 
< it  is  not.  **  Increase  and  multiply  ! "  commanded  the  Lord. 
< E.  Graham  Howe,  author  of  War  Dance,  put  it  another  way,  which 
< I  like  even  better.  "  Create  and  share!"  he  counseled.  And,  though 
< reading  may  not  at  first  blush  seem  like  an  act  of  creation,  in  a  deep 
< sense  it  is.  Without  the  enthusiastic  reader,  who  is  really  the  author's 
< coimterpart  and  very  often  his  most  secret  rival,  a  book  would  die. 
< The  man  who  spreads  the  good  word  augments  not  only  the  life  of 
< the  book  in  question  but  the  act  of  creation  itself.  He  breathes  spirit 
< into  other  readers.  He  sustains  the  creative  spirit  everywhere. 
< Whether  he  is  aware  of  it  or  not,  what  he  is  doing  is  praising  God's 
< handiwork.  For,  the  good  reader,  like  the  good  author,  knows  that 
< 
< 28 
< 
< 
< THEY  WERE  ALIVE  AND  THEY  SPOKE  TO  ME 
< 
< everything  stems  from  the  same  source.  He  knows  that  he  could  not 
< participate  in  the  author's  private  experience  were  he  not  composed 
< of  the  same  substance  through  and  through.  And  when  I  say  author 
< I  mean  Author.  The  writer  is,  of  course,  the  best  of  all  readers,  for  in 
< writing,  or  **  creating,"  as  it  is  called,  he  is  but  reading  and  transcrib- 
< ing the  great  message  of  creation  which  the  Creator  in  his  goodness 
< has  made  manifest  to  him. 
< 
< In  the  Appendix  the  reader  will  find  a  list  of  authors  and  titles 
< arranged  in  a  firank  and  curious  way.*  I  mention  it  because  I  think 
< it  important  to  stress  at  the  outset  a  psychological  fact  about  the 
< reading  of  books  which  is  rather  neglected  in  most  works  on  the 
< subject.  It  is  this  :  many  of  the  books  one  Uves  with  in  one's  mind 
< are  books  one  has  never  read.  Sometimes  these  take  on  amazing 
< importance.  There  are  at  least  three  categories  of  this  order.  The 
< first  comprises  those  books  which  one  has  every  intention  of  reading 
< some  day  but  in  all  probability  never  will ;  the  second  comprises 
< those  books  which  one  feels  he  ought  to  have  read,  and  which,  some 
< at  least,  he  undoubtedly  will  read  before  he  dies  ;  the  third  comprises 
< the  books  one  hears  about,  talks  about,  reads  about,  but  which  one 
< is  almost  certain  never  to  read  because  nothing,  seemingly,  can  ever 
< break  down  the  wall  of  prejudice  erected  against  them. 
< 
< In  the  first  category  are  those  monumental  works,  classics  mostly, 
< which  one  is  usually  ashamed  to  admit  he  has  never  read :  tomes 
< one  nibbles  at  occasionally,  only  to  push  them  away,  more  than  ever 
< convinced  that  they  are  still  unreadable.  The  list  varies  with  the 
< individual.  For  myself,  to  give  a  few  outstanding  names,  they 
< comprise  the  works  of  such  celebrated  authors  as  Homer,  Aristotle, 
< Francis  Bacon,  Hegel,  Rousseau  (excepting  Entile),  Robert  Brown- 
< ing, Santayana.  In  the  second  category  I  include  Arabia  Deserta,  the 
< Decline  and  Fall  of  the  Roman  Empire,  The  Hundred  and  Twenty  Days 
< of  Sodom,  Casanova's  Memoirs,  Napoleon's  Memoirs,  Michelet's 
< History  of  the  French  Revolution.  In  the  third  Pepys'  Diary,  Tristram 
< Shandy,  Wilhelm  Meister,  The  Anatomy  of  Melancholy,  The  Red 
< and  the  Black,  Marius  the  Epicurean,  The  Education  of  Henry  Adams. 
< 
< Sometimes  a  chance  reference  to  an  author  one  has  neglected  to 
< read  or  abandoned  all  thought  of  ever  reading — a  passage,  say,  in 
< the  work  of  an  author  one  admires,  or  the  words  of  a  friend  who  is 
< 
< *  That  is,  those  I  have  read  and  those  I  still  hope  to  read.

< THE    BOOKS    IN    MY    LIFE, 
< 
< ako  a  book  lover— is  sufficient  to  make  one  run  for  a  book,  read  it 
< with  new  eyes  and  claim  it  as  one's  very  own.  In  the  main,  however, 
< the  books  one  neglects,  or  deUberately  spurns,  seldom  get  read.  Cer- 
< tain subjects,  certain  styles,  or  unfortunate  associations  connected  v^dth 
< the  very  names  of  certain  books,  create  a  repugnance  almost 
< insuperable.  Nothing  on  earth,  for  example,  could  induce  me  to 
< tackle  anew  Spenser's  Faery  Queen,  which  I  began  in  college  and 
< fortunately  dropped  because  I  left  that  institution  in  a  hurry.  Never 
< again  will  I  look  at  a  line  of  Edmund  Burke,  or  Addison,  or  Chaucer, 
< though  the  last-named  I  think  altogether  worthy  of  reading.  Racine 
< and  Comeille  are  two  others  I  doubt  if  I  shall  ever  look  at  again, 
< though  Comeille  intrigues  me  because  of  a  brilliant  essay  I 
< read  not  long  ago  on  Phldre  in  The  Cloums  Grail*  On  the 
< other  hand  there  are  books  which  He  at  the  very  foundations 
< ^  of  literature  but  which  are  so  remote  from  one's  thinking 
< '  and  experience  as  to  render  them  "  untouchable."  Certain 
< authors,  supposed  to  be  the  bulwark  of  our  particular  Western 
< culture,  are  more  foreign  in  spirit  to  me  than  are  the  Chinese, 
< the  Arabs,  or  primitive  peoples.  Some  of  the  most  exciting 
< Hterary  works  spring  from  cultures  which  have  not  contributed 
< directly  to  our  development.  No  fairy  tales,  for  example,  have 
< /--v  exercised  a  more  potent  influence  over  me  than  those  of  the  Japanese, 
< r^  which  I  became  acquainted  with  through  the  work  of  Lafcadio 
< Heam,  one  of  the  exotic  figures  in  American  Hterature.  No  stories 
< were  more  seductive  to  me  as  a  child  than  those  drawn  from  the 
< Arabian  Nights*  Entertainment.  American  Indian  folklore  leaves  me 
< cold,  whereas  the  folklore  of  Afiica  is  near  and  dear  to  me.f  And, 
< as  I  have  said  repeatedly,  whatever  I  read  of  Chinese  Uterature 
< (barring  Confiidus)  seems  as  if  written  by  my  immediate  ancestors. 
< I  said  that  sometimes  it  is  an  esteemed  author  who  puts  one  on 
< the  track  of  a  buried  book.  **  What!  He  liked  that  book?"  you 
< say  to  yourself,  and  immediately  the  barriers  fall  away  and  the  mind 
< becomes  not  only  open  and  receptive  but  positively  aflame.  Often 
< it  happens  that  it  is  not  a  friend  of  similar  tastes  who  revives  one's 
< interest  in  a  dead  book  but  a  chance  acquaintance.   Sometimes  this

< individual  gives  the  impression  of  being  a  nitwit,  and  one  wonders 
< why  he  should  retain  the  memory  of  a  book  which  this  person 
< casually  recommended,  or  perhaps  did  not  recommend  at  all  but 
< merely  mentioned  in  the  course  of  conversation  as  being  an  **  odd  " 
< book.  In  a  vacant  mood,  at  loose  ends,  as  we  say,  suddenly  the 
< recollection  of  this  conversation  occurs,  and  we  are  ready  to  give  the 
< book  a  trial.  Then  comes  a  hock,  the  shock  of  discovery.  Wuthering 
< Heights  is  for  me  an  example  of  this  sort.  From  having  heard  it 
< praised  so  much  and  so  often,  I  had  concluded  that  it  was  impossible 
< for  an  English  novel — ^by  a  woman  ! — to  be  that  good.  Then  one 
< day  a  friend,  whose  taste  I  suspected  to  be  shallow,  let  drop  a  few 
< pregnant  words  about  it.  Though  I  promptly  proceeded  to  forget 
< his  remarks,  the  poison  sank  into  me.  Without  realizing  it,  I  nur- 
< tured a  secret  resolve  to  have  a  look  at  this  famous  book  one  day. 
< Finally,  just  a  few  years  ago,  Jean  Varda  put  it  in  my  hands.*  I 
< read  it  in  one  gulp,  astoimded  as  is  everyone,  I  suspect,  by  its  amazing 
< power  and  beauty.  Yes,  one  of  the  very  great  novels  in  the  EngHsh 
< language.  And  I,  through  pride  and  prejudice,  had  almost  missed 
< reading  it. 
< 
< Quite  another  story  is  that  of  The  City  of  God.  Many  years  ago 
< I  had,  like  everyone  else,  read  the  Confessions  of  St.  Augustine.  And 
< it  had  made  a  deep  impression.  Then,  in  Paris,  some  one  thrust 
< upon  me  The  City  of  God^  in  two  volumes.  I  found  it  not  only 
< boring  and  deadly,  but  in  parts  monstrously  ridiculous.  An  English 
< bookseller,  hearing  from  a  mutual  friend — to  his  surprise,  no  doubt — 
< that  I  had  read  this  work  informed  me  that  he  could  get  a  good 
< price  for  it  if  I  would  only  annotate  it.  I  sat  down  to  read  it  once 
< again,  taking  elaborate  pains  to  make  copious  remarks,  usually 
< derogatory,  in  the  margins  ;  after  spending  a  month  or  so  at  this 
< vain  task  I  dispatched  the  book  to  England.  Twenty  years  later  I 
< received  a  post  card  from  this  same  bookseller  stating  that  he  hoped 
< to  sell  the  copy  in  a  few  days — ^he  had  found  a  buyer  for  it  at  last. 
< And  that  was  the  last  I  heard  from  him.  Droie  d'histoire  !

< Throughout  my  Hfe  the  word  **  confessions  "  in  a  title  has  alwa)^ 
< acted  like  a  magnet.  I  mentioned  Strindberg's  Confession  of  a  Fool,  i
