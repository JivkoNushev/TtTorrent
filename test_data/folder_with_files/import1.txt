QUOTATIONS     FROM    WRITERS 

**  All  I  have  written  now  appears  to  me  as  so  much  straw." 
(Thomas  Aquinas  on  his  deathbed.) 

"When  the  artist  has  exhausted  his  materials,  when  the  faney 
no  longer  paints,  when  thoughts  are  no  longer  apprehended,  and 
books  are  a  weariness — he  has  always  the  resource  to  live.** 

(Ralph  Waldo  Emerson.) 

**  All  is  marvellous  for  the  poet,  all  is  divine  for  the  saint,  all  is 
great  for  the  hero  ;  all  is  wretched,  miserable,  ugly  and  bad  for  the 
base  and  sordid  souL" 

(Amiel.) 

"  Probably,  even  in  our  time,  an  artist  might  find  his  imagination 
considerably  stimulated  and  his  work  powerfiilly  improved  if  he 
knew  that  anything  short  of  his  best  would  bring  him  to  the  gallows, 
with  or  without  trial  by  jury  ..." 

(Henry  Adams.) 

"  Apr^  avoir  pris  un  an  de  vacances  (15  sept.  '49 — 15  sept.  '50), 
me  marier,  un  peu  voyager  en  Suisse,  Luxembourg,  HoUande, 
Angleterre,  Belgique,  soigner  mes  yeux,  faire  trois  mois  de  radio, 
d^m^nager,  me  r^installer  ^  Paris— je  me  suis  remis  au  travail, 
h^las  !  .  .  .  Petit  k  petit  je  vais  m*enfoncer  dans  cet  univers  qui

PREFACE 

The  purpose  of  this  book,  which  will  run  to  several  volumes  in 
the  course  of  the  next  few  years,  is  to  round  out  the  story  of  my 
life.  It  deals  with  books  as  vital  experience.  It  is  not  a  critical 
study  nor  does  it  contain  a  program  for  self-education. 

One  of  the  results  of  this  self-examination — for  that  is  what  the 
writing  of  this  book  amounts  to — is  the  confirmed  belief  that  one 
should  read  less  and  less,  not  more  and  more.  As  a  glance  at  the 
Appendix  will  reveal,  I  have  not  read  nearly  as  much  as  the  scholar, 
the  bookworm,  or  even  the  "  well-educated  "  man — yet  I  have 
undoubtedly  read  a  hundred  times  more  than  I  should  have  read 
for  my  own  good.  Only  one  out  of  five  in  America,  it  is  said, 
are  readers  of  "  books."  But  even  this  small  number  read  far  too 
much.    Scarcely  any  one  lives  wisely  or  fiilly. 

There  have  been  and  always  will  be  books  which  are  truly  revolu- 
tionary— that  is  to  say,  inspired  and  inspiring.  They  are  few  and 
fiir  between,  of  course.  One  is  lucky  to  run  across  a  handfiil  in 
a  Ufetime.  Moreover,  these  are  not  the  books  which  invade  the 
general  pubHc.  They,  are  thei  hidden  reservoirs  which  feed  the 
men  of  lesser  talent  who  know  how  to  appeal  to  the  man  in  the 
street.  The  vast  body  of  Hterature,  in  every  domain,  is  composed 
of  hand-me-down  ideas.  The  question — ^never  resolved,  alas  ! — 
is  to  what  extent  it  would  be  efficacious  to  curtail  the  overwhelming 
supply  of  cheap  fodder.  One  thing  is  certain  today — the  illiterate 
are  definitely  not  the  least  inteUigctit  among  us. 

i      If  it  be  knowledge  or  wisdom  one  is  seeking,  then  one  had  better  . 

!  go  direct  to  the  source. .  And  the  source  is  not  the  scholar  or  philo-  j      \ 
sopher,  not  the  master,  saint,  or  teacher,  but  Ufe  itself— direct  ! 
experience  of  life.  ■  The  same  is  true  for  art.    Here,  too,  we  can 
dispense  with  **  the  masters.**    When  I  say  life  I  have  in  mind,  to 
be  sure,  another  kind  of  hfe  than  that  we  know  today.    I  have  in 
mind  the  sort  which  D.  H.  Lawrence  speaks  of  in  Etruscan  Places.*

PREFACE 


Or  that  Henry  Adams  speaks  of  when  the  Virgin  reigned  supreme 
at  Chartres. 

In  tliis  age,  which  beHeves  that  there  is  a  short  cut  to  everything, 
the  greatest  lesson  to  be  learned  is  that  the  most  difficult  way  is, 
in  the  long  run,  the  easiest.  All  that  is  set  forth  in  books,  all  that 
seems  so  terribly  vital  and  significant,  is  but  an  iota  of  that  from 
which  it  stems  and  which  it  is  within  everyone's  power  to  tap. 
Our  whole  theory  of  education  is  based  on  the  absurd  notion  that 
we  must  learn  to  swim  on  land  before  tackling  the  water.  It  applies 
to  the  pursuit  of  the  arts  as  well  as  to  the  pursuit  of  knowledge. 
Men  are  still  being  taught  to  create  by  studying  other  men's  works 
or  by  making  plans  and  sketches  never  intended  to  materialize. 
The  ait  of  writing  is  taught  in  the  classroom  instead  of  in  the  thick 
of  hfe.  Students  are  still  being  handed  models  which  are  supposed 
to  fit  all  temperaments,  all  kinds  of  intelligence.  No  wonder  we 
produce  better  engineers  than  writers,  better  industrial  experts 
than  painters. 

My  encounters  with  books  I  regard  very  much  as  my  encounters 
with  other  phenomena  of  Hfe  or  thought.  All  encounters  are  con- 
figurate, not  isolate.  In  this  sense,  and  in  this  sense  only,  books 
are  as  much  a  part  of  Ufe  as  trees,  stars  or  dung.  I  have  no  reverence 
for  them  per  se.  Nor  do  I  put  authors  in  any  special,  privileged 
category.  They  are  Uke  other  men,  no  better,  no  worse.  They 
exploit  the  powers  given  them,  just  as  any  other  order  of  human 
being.  If  I  defend  them  now  and  then — as  a  class — ^it  is  because 
I  beheve  that,  in  our  society  at  least,  they  have  never  achieved  the 
status  and  the  consideration  they  merit.  The  great  ones,  especially, 
have  almost  always  been  treated  as  scapegoats. 

To  see  myself  as  the  reader  I  once  was  is  Hke  watching  a  man 
fighting  his  way  through  a  jungle.  To  be  sure,  living  in  the  heart 
of  the  jungle  I  learned  a  few  things  about  the  jungle.  But  my  aim 
was  never  to  live  in  the  jungle — ^it  was  to  get  clear  of  it !  It  is  my 
firm  conviction  that  it  is  not  necessary  to  first  inhabit  this  jungle 
of  books.  Life  itself  is  enough  of  a  jungle — a  very  real  and  a  very 
instructive  one,  to  say  the  least.  But,  you  ask,  may  not  books  be  a 
help,  a  guide,  in  fighting  our  way  through  the  wilderness  ?  "  N'ira 
pas  loin,"  said  Napoleon,  "  celui  qui  sait  d'avance  ou  il  veut  aller.** 

The  principal  aim  underlying  this  work  is  to  render  homage 

12 


PREFACE 


where  homage  is  due,  a  task  which  I  know  beforehand  is  impossible 
of  accompHshment.  Were  I  to  do  it  properly,  I  would  have  to  get 
down  on  my  knees  and  thank  each  blade  of  grass  for  rearing  its 
head.  What  chiefly  motivates  me  in  this  vain  task  is  the  fact  that 
in  general  we  know  all  too  little  about  the  influences  which  shape 
a  writer's  Hfe  and  work.  The  critic,  in  his  pompous  conceit  and 
arrogance,  distorts  the  true  picture  beyond  all  recognition.  The 
author,  however  truthful  he  may  think  himself  to  be,  inevitably 
disguises  the  picture.  The  psychologist,  with  his  single-track  view 
of  things,  only  deepens  the  blur.  As  author,  I  do  not  think  myself 
an  exception  to  the  rule.  I,  too,  am  guilty  of  altering,  distorting 
and  disguising  the  facts — if  "  facts  "  there  be.  My  conscious  eflbrt, 
however,  has  been — perhaps  to  a  fault — in  the  opposite  direction. 
I  am  on  the  side  of  revelation,  if  not  always  on  the  side  of  beauty, 
truth,  wisdom,  harmony  and  ever-evolving  perfection.  In  this 
work  I  am  throwing  out  fresh  data,  to  be  judged  and  analyzed, 
or  accepted  and  enjoyed  for  enjoyment's  sake.  Naturally  I  cannot 
write  about  all  the  books,  or  even  all  the  significant  ones,  which 
I  have  read  in  the  course  of  my  life.  But  I  do  intend  to  go  on  writing 
about  books  and  authors  until  I  have  exhausted  the  importance 
(for  me)  of  this  domain  of  reaUty. 

To  have  undertaken  the  thankless  task  of  listing  all  the  books 
I  can  recall  ever  reading  gives  me  extreme  pleasure  and  satisfaction. 
I  know  of  no  author  who  has  been  mad  enough  to  attempt  this.^ 
Perhaps  my  Hst  will  give  rise  to  more  confusion — but  its  purpose 
is  not  that.  Those  who  know  how  to  read  a  man  know  how  to  read 
his  books.    For  these  the  Hst  will  speak  for  itself 

In  writing  of  the  "  amoraUsme  "  of  Goethe,  Jules  de  Gaultier, 
quoting  Goethe,  I  beUeve,  says  :  "La  vraie  nostalgic  doit  toujours 
etre  productrice  et  cr^er  une  nouvelle  chose  qui  soit  meilleure." 
At  the  core  of  this  book  there  is  a  genuine  nostalgia.  It  is  not  a 
nostalgia  for  the  past  itself,  as  may  sometimes  appear  to  be  the 
case,  nor  is  it  a  nostalgia  for  the  irretrievable  ;  it  is  a  nostalgia  for 
moments  Uved  to  the  fullest.  These  moments  occurred  sometimes 
through  contact  with  books,  sometimes  through  contact  with 
men  and  women  I  have  dubbed  **  Uving  books."  Sometimes  it  is  a 
nostalgia  for  the  companionship  of  those  boys  I  grew  up  with  and 
with  whom  one  of  the  strongest  bonds  I  had  was — books.     (Yet 

13 


PREFACE 

here  I  must  confess  that,  however  bright  and  revivifying  these 
memories,  they  are  as  nothing  to  the  remembrance  of  days  spent 
in  the  company  of  my  former  idols-in-the-flesh,  those  boys — ^still 
boys  to  me  ! — who  went  by  the  immortal  names  of  Johnny  Paul, 
Eddie  Carney,  Lester  Reardon,  Johnny  and  Jimmy  Dunne,  none 
of  whom  did  I  ever  sec  with  a  book  or  associate  with  a  book  in 
the  remotest  way.)  Whether  it  was  Goethe  who  said  it  or  de  Gaul- 
tier,  I  too  most  firmly  beUeve  that  true  nostalgia  must  always  be 
productive  and  conducive  to  the  creation  of  new  and  better  things. 
If  it  were  merely  to  rehash  the  past,  whether  in  the  form  of  books, 
persons  or  events,  my  task  would  be  a  vain  and  fiitile  one.  Cold 
and  dead  as  it  may  now  seem,  the  list  of  titles  given  in  the 
Appendix  may  prove  for  some  kindred  souls  to  be  the  key 
with  which  to  unlock  their  living  moments  of  joy  and  plenitude 
in  the  past.  ^ 

One  of  the  reasons  I  bother  to  write  a  preface,  which  is  always 
something  of  a  bore  to  the  reader,  one  of  the  reasons  I  have  rewritten 
it  for  the  fifth  and,  I  hope,  the  last  time,  is  the  fear  that  its  completion 
may  be  frustrated  by  some  unforeseen  event.  This  first  volume 
finished,  I  have  immediately  to  set  to  work  to  write  the  third  and 
last  book  of  The  Rosy  Crucifixion,  the  hardest  task  I  ever  set 
myself  and  one  which  I  have  avoided  for  many  a  year.  I  would 
like,  therefore,  while  time  permits,  to  give  a  hint  of  some 
of  the  things  I  planned  or  hoped  to  write  about  in  succeeding 
volumes. 

Naturally,  I  had  some  sort  of  flexible  plan  in  mind  when  I  began 
this  work.  Unlike  the  architect,  however,  an  author  often  discards 
his  blueprint  in  the  process  of  erecting  his  edifice.  To  the  writer 
a  book  is  something  to  be  hved  through,  an  experience,  not  a  plan 
to  be  executed  in  accordance  with  laws  and  specifications.  At  any 
rate,  whatever  is  left  of  my  original  plan  has  grown  tenuous  and 
complicated  as  a  spider's  web.  It  is  only  in  bringing  this  volume 
to  a  close  that  I  have  come  to  realize  how  much  I  wish  to  say,  and 
have  to  say,  about  certain  authors,  certain  subjects,  some  of  which 
I  have  already  touched  upon.*   For  example,  no  matter  how  often 

*  An  American  whose  influence  I  may  have  minimized  is  Jack  London. 
Glancing  through  his  Essays  of  Revolt,  edited  by  Leonard  D.  Abbott,  I  recalled 
the  great  thrill  it  gave  me,  a  boy  of  fourteen,  to  merely  hear  the  name  Jofk

PREP ACB 


I  refer  to  him  I  have  never  said,  and  probably  never  will  say,  all 

that  I  mean  to  say  about  Elie  Faure.    Nor  have  I  by  any  means 

exhausted  the  subject  of  Blaise  Cendrars.   And  then  there  is  Celine, 

a  giant  among  our  contemporaries,  whom  I  have  not  even  begun 

to  approach.    As  for  Rider  Haggard,  I  shall  certainly  have  more 

to  say  about  him,  in  particular,  his  Ayesha,  the  sequel  to  She^.  When 

it  comes  to  Emerson,  Dostoievsky,  Maeterlinck,  Knut  Hamsim, 

G.  A.  Henty.  I  know  I  shall  never  say  my  last  word  about  them.  \/ 

A  subject  like  The  Grand  Inquisitor,  for  example,  or  The  Eterttal 

Husband— my  favorite  of  all  Dostoievsky's  works — would  seem  to  j  "p 

demand  separate  books  in  themselves.     Perhaps  when  I  come  to  i 

Berdyaev  and  that  great  flock  of  exalted  Russian  writers  of  the 

Nineteenth  century,  the  men  with  the  eschatological  flair,  I  shall 

get  roimd  to  saying  some  of  the  things  I  have  been  wanting  to  say 

for  twenty  years  or  more.   Then  there  is  the  Marquis  de  Sade,  one 

of  the  most  maligned,  defamed,  misunderstood — deliberately  and 

wilfully  misunderstood — figures  in  all  Htcrature.    Time  I  came  to 

grips  with  him  !    Back  of  him  and  overshadowing  him  stands  the 

figure  of  Gilles  de  Rais,  one  of  the  most  glorious,  sinister,  enigmatic 

figures  in  all  European  history.    In  the  letter  to  Pierre  Lesdain  I 

said  I  had  not  yet  received  a  good  book  on  Gilles  de  Rais.    In  the  ' 

meantime  a  fiiend  has  sent  me  one  firom  Paris,  and  I  have  read  it. 


Loitdori.  To  us  who  hungered  for  life  he  was  a  shining  light,  adored  as 
much  for  his  revolutionary  fervor  as  for  his  wild,  adventurous  life.  How 
strange  now  to  read,  ia  Leonard  Abbott's  Introduction,  that  in  the  year 
1905  (0  J^ck  London  was  proclaiming  :  "  The  revolution  is  here  now^. 
Stop  it  who  can  ! "  How  strange  now  to  read  the  opening  words  of  his 
famous  speech  on  "  Revolution,"  which  he  delivered  to  university  students 
throughout  America — how  did  it  ever  happen  f — ^telling  of  the  seven  million 
men  and  women  then  enrolled  throughout  the  world  in  the  army  of  revolt. 
Listen  to  Jack  London's  words  : 

**  There  has  never  been  anything  like  this  revolution  in  the  history  of  the 
world.  There  is  nothing  analogous  between  it  and  the  American  Revolution 
or  the  French  Revolution.  It  is  unique,  colossal.  Other  revolutions  compare 
with  it  as  asteroids  compare  with  the  sun.  It  is  alone  of  its  kind,  the  first 
world  revolution  in  a  world  whose  history  is  replete  with  revolutions.  And 
not  only  this,  for  it  is  the  first  organized  movement  of  men  to  become  a 
world  movement,  limited  only  by  the  limits  of  the  planet.  This  revolution 
is  unlike  all  other  revolutions  in  many  respects.  It  is  not  sporadic.  It  is  not 
a  flame  of  popular  discontent,  arising  in  a  ^y  and  dying  down  in  a  day  . .  ." 

One  of  the  first  Americans,  I  presume,  to  make  a  fortune  with  the  pen. 
Jack  London  resigned  firom  the  Socialist  Party  in  1916,  accusing  it  of  lacking 
fire  and  fight.  One  wonders  what  he  would  say  today,  were  he  alive,  about 
"  the  devolution."

PREFACE 

It  is  just  the  book  I  was  looking  for  ;  it  is  called  Gilles  de  Rais  et 
son  temps  by  George  Meunier* 

Here  are  a  few  more  books  and  authors  I  intend  to  dwell  on  in 
the  future  :  Algernon  Blackwood,  author  of  The  Bright  Messenger^ 
to  my  mind  the  most  extraordinary  novel  on  psychoanalysis,  one 
which  dwarfs  the  subject ;  The  Path  to  Rome,  by  Hilaire  Belloc, 
an  early  favorite  and  a  steadfast  love  :  each  time  I  read  the  opening 
pages,  **  Praise  of  This  Book,"  I  dance  with  joy  ;  Marie  CoreUi, 
a  contemporary  of  Rider  Haggard,  Yeats,  Tennyson,  Oscar  Wilde, 
who  said  of  herself  in  a  letter  to  the  vicar  of  the  parish  church  at 
Stratford-on-Avon  :  "  With  regard  to  the  Scriptures,  I  do  not 
think  any  woman  has  ever  studied  them  so  deeply  and  devoutly  as 
I  have,  or,  let  me  say,  more  deeply  and  devoutly."  I  shall  certainly 
write  about  Rene  Caill^,  the  first  white  man  to  enter  Timbuctoo 
and  get  out  ahve  ;  his  story,  as  related  by  Galbraith  Welch  in  The 
Unueiling  of  Timbuctoo,  is  to  my  mind  the  greatest  adventure  story 
in  modem  times.  And  Nostradamus,  Janko  Lavrin,  Paul  Brunton, 
Peguy,  Ouspensky's  In  Search  of  tlie  Miraculous,  Letters  from  the 
Mahatmas,  Fechner's  Life  After  Death,  Claude  Houghton's  meta- 
physical novels,  Cyril  Connolly's  Enemies  of  Promise  (another  book 
about  books),  the  language  of  night,  as  Eugene  Jolas  calls  it,  Donald 
Keyhoe's  book  on  the  flying  saucers,  cybernetics  and  dianetics, 
the  importance  of  nonsense,  the  subject  of  resurrection  and  ascension, 
and,  among  other  things,  a  recent  book  by  Carlo  Suares  (the  same 
who  wrote  on  Krishnamurti),  entitled  Le  Mythc  Judeo-Chritien. 

I  shall  also — "  why  not  ?  "  as  Picasso  says — expatiate  on  the  subject 
of  **  pornography  and  obscenity  "  in  Uterature.  In  fact,  I  have 
already  written  quite  a  few  pages  on  this  theme,  which  I  have 
held  over  for  the  second  volume.  Meanwhile  I  am  very  much  in 
need  of  authentic  data.  I  should  like  to  know,  for  example,  what 
are  the  great  pornographic  books  of  all  time.    (I  know  but  a  very 

*  In  Paris,  about  1931  or  1932,  Richard  Thoma  gave  me  a  copy  of  his  book 
on  Gilles  de  Rais,  called  Tragedy  in  Blue.  A  few  weeks  ago  I  received  a 
reprint  of  this  book,  published  as  an  anonymous  work  and  entitled  The 
Authorized  Version — Book  Three — The  Book  of  Sapphire.  Rereading  it,  I 
was  overcome  with  mortification  that  I  could  have  forgotten  the  power 
and  the  splendor  of  this  work.  It  is  a  poetic  justification,  I  might  almost, 
say,  or  paean  or  dithyramb,  only  fifty-one  pages  long,  unique  in  its  genre, 
and  true  as  only  highly  imaginative  works  can  be.  It  is  a  breviary  for  the 
initiated.  Apologies  and  congratulations,  Dicko  !

few.)  who  are  the  writers  who  arc  still  regarded  as  *'  obscene  "  ? 
How  widely  are  their  books  circulated  and  where  chiefly  ?  In 
what  languages  ?  I  can  think  of  only  three  great  writers  whose 
works  are  still  banned  in  England  and  America,  and  then  only 
certain  of  their  works,  not  all.  I  mean  the  Marquis  de  Sade  (whose 
most  sensational  work  is  still  banned  in  France),  Aretino  and  D.  H. 
Lawrence.  What  of  Restif  de  la  Bretonne,  concerning  whom 
an  American,  J.  Rives  Childs,  has  compiled  (in  French)  a  formidable 
tome  of  **  t^moignages  et  jugements  "  ?  And  what  about  that 
first  pornographic  novel  in  the  English  language.  The  Memoirs 
of  Fanny  Hill  ?  Why,  if  it  is  so  "  dull,"  has  it  not  become  a  **  classic  " 
by  now,  free  to  circulate  in  drug  stores,  railway  stations  and  other 
innocent  places  ?  It  is  just  two  hundred  years  since  it  first  appeared, 
and  it  has  never  gone  out  of  print,  as  every  American  tourist  in 
Paris  well  knows. 

Curious,  but  of  all  the  books  I  was  searching  for  while  writing 
this  first  volume,  the  two  I  wanted  most  have  not  turned  up  : 
The  Thirteen  Crucified  Saviours,  by  Sir  Godfi-ey  Higgins,  author 
of  the  celebrated  Atiacalypsis,  and  Les  Clifs  de  V Apocalypse,  by 
O.  V.  Milosz,  the  Polish  poet  who  died  not  long  ago  at  Fontaine- 
bleau.  Nor  have  I  yet  received  a  good  book  on  the  Children's 
Crusades. 

There  are  three  magazines  I  forgot  to  mention  when  speaking  of 
good  magazines  :  Jugend,  The  Enemy  (edited  by  that  amazing, 
bright  spirit,  Wyndham  Lewis),  and  The  Masque  of  Gordon  Craig. 

And  now  a  word  about  the  man  to  whom  this  book  is  dedicated 
— Lawrence  Clark  Powell.  It  was  on  one  of  his  visits  to  Big  Sur 
that  this  individual,  who  knows  more  about  books  than  any  one 
I  have  ever  had  the  good  fortune  to  meet,  suggested  that  I  write 
(for  him  if  for  no  one  else)  a  short  book  about  my  experience  with 
books.  Some  months  later  the  germ,  which  had  always  been 
dormant,  took  hold.  After  writing  about  fifty  pages  I  knew  that 
I  could  never  rest  content  with  a  summary  account  of  the  subject. 
Powell  knew  it  too,  no  doubt,  but  he  was  cunning  or  discreet 
enough  to  keep  it  to  himself.    I  owe  Larry  Powell  a  great  deal. 

r  one  thing,  and  it  is  a  big  thing  to  me  because  it  means  the 

rrection  of  a  false  attitude,  I  owe  him  my  present  ability  to  view 
hbrarians  as  human  beings,  very  Hve  human  beings,  sometimes,

and  capable  of  proving  dynamic  forces  in  our  midst.  Certainly 
no  librarian  could  be  more  zealous  than  he  in  making  books  a 
vital  part  of  our  life,  which  they  are  not  at  present.  Nor  could  any 
librarian  have  given  me  greater  direct  aid  than  he.  Not  a  single 
question  have  I  put  to  him  which  he  has  not  answered  fully  and 
scrupulously.  No  request  of  any  sort,  in  fact,  has  he  ever  turned 
down.  Should  this  book  prove  to  be  a  failure  it  will  not  be  his 
feult. 

Here  I  must  add  a  few  words  about  other  individuals  who 
extended  their  aid  in  one  way  or  another.  First  and  foremost, 
Dante  T.  Zaccagnini  of  Port  Chester,  New  York.  You,  Dante, 
whom  I  have  never  met,  how  can  I  express  to  you  my  deep  gratitude 
for  all  the  arduous  labors  you  performed — and  voluntarily  ! — on 
my  behalf  i  I  blush  to  think  what  humdrum  tasks  some  of  them 
were.  In  addition  you  insisted  on  making  me  gifts  of  some  of 
your  most  precious  books — ^because  you  thought  I  had  more  need 
of  them  than  you  !  And  what  helpfid  suggestions  you  made,  vi^t 
subtle  corrections  !  All  done  with  discretion,  tact,  humility  and 
devotion.  Words  fail  me. 

It  should  be  undentood  that  when  I  began  this  task  there  were, 
I  felt,  several  hundred  books  which  I  needed  to  borrow  or  to  own. 
My  only  recourse,  not  having  the  money  to  buy  them,  was  to 
make  up  a  list  of  titles  and  disseminate  it  among  my  friends  and 
acquaintances — and,  among  my  readers.  The  men  and  women 
whose  names  I  have  given  at  the  close  of  this  volume  suppHed  me 
with  my  wants.  Many  of  these  were  simply  readers  whom  I  got  to 
know  through  correspondence.  The  "  friends  "  who  could  most 
afford  to  send  me  the  books  I  so  sorely  needed,  and  whom  I  counted 
upon,  failed  to  come  through.  An  experience  of  this  sort  is  always 
illuminating.  The  friends  who  fail  you  are  always  replaced  by 
new  ones  who  appear  at  the  critical  moment  and  from  the  most 
unexpected  quarten. . . 

One  of  the  few  rewards  an  author  obtains  for  his  labors  is  the 
conversion  of  a  reader  into  a  warm,  personal  friend.  One  of  the 
rare  deHghts  he  experiences  is  to  receive  exactly  the  gift  he  was 
waiting  for  from  an  unknown  reader.  Every  sincere  writer  has, 
I  take  it,  hundreds,  perhaps  thousands,  of  such  unknown  friends 
among  his  readers.  There  may  be,  and  doubtless  arc,  authors  who 
i8 


PREFACE 

have  little  need  of  their  readers  except  as  purchasers  of  their  books. 
My  case  is  somewhat  different.  I  have  need  of  every  one.  I  am  a 
borrower  and  a  lender.  I  make  use  of  any  and  all  who  volunteer 
their  aid.  I  would  be  ashamed  not  to  accept  these  gracious  over- 
tures. The  latest  one  was  from  a  student  at  Yale,  Donald  A.  Schon. 
In  filing  a  letter  of  mine  to  Professor  Henri  Peyre  of  the  French 
Department  there,  a  letter  in  which  I  had  made  an  appeal  for  clerical 
help,  this  young  man  read  my  letter  and  spontaneously  offered  his 
services.     (A  grand  gesture  !  Sehr  Schon  !) 

A  case  in  point  is  the  fortuitous  emergence  of  John  Kidis  of 
Sacramento.  A  request  for  a  signed  photograph  led  to  a  brief 
interchange  of  letters  followed  by  a  visit  and  a  shower  of  gifts. 
John  Kidis  (originally  Mestakidis)  is  a  Greek,  whidi  explains  mudi. 
But  it  doesn't  explain  everything.  I  dont  know  which  I  appreciate 
the  more,  the  armfiils  of  books  (some  of  them  very  difficult  to  find) 
which  he  dumped  on  my  desk  or  the  never-ceasing  flow  of  gifts, 
viz.,  sweaters  and  socks  of  pure  wool  and  nylon,  knitted  by  his 
mother,  trousers,  caps,  and  other  articles  of  clothing  picked  up 
here  and  there,  Greek  pastries  (such  deHcious  deHcacies  !)  prepared 
by  his  grandmother  or  his  aunt,  tins  of  Halva,  jugs  of  rezina,  toys 
for  the  children,  writing  materials  (paper,  envelopes  of  all  kinds, 
post  cards  with  my  name  and  address  printed  on  them,  carbon 
paper,  pencils,  blotters),  circulars  and  announcements,  baptismal 
towels  (his  father  is  a  priest),  dates  and  nuts  of  all  kinds,  firesh  figs, 
oranges,  apples,  even  pomegranates  (all  from  the  mythical "  farm  "), 
to  say  nothing  of  the  typing  he  did  for  me,  or  the  printing  {Tfie 
Waters  RegUtterized,  for  example),  the  water  colors  he  bought, 
the  paper  and  paints  he  supplied  me  with,  the  errands  he  volunteered 
to  run,  the  books  he  sold  for  me  (throwing  out  all  his  other  stock- 
in-trade  and  setting  himself  up  as  **  The  House  of  Henry  Miller  "), 
the  tires  he  bought  for  me,  the  music  he  offered  to  get  me  (records, 
sheet  music,  albums),  and  so  on  and  so  on  ad  infinitum.  .  .  .  How 
is  one  to  account  for  such  generosity  ?    How  ever  repay  it  ? 

It  goes  without  saying,  I  trust,  that  I  shall  welcome  from  the 
readers  of  tliis  book  any  and  all  indications  of  error,  omission, 
falsification  or  misjudgment.  I  am  well  aware  that  this  book,  because 
it  is  "  about  books,"  will  go  to  many  who  have  never  read  me 
before,    I  hope  that  they  will  spread  the  good  word,  not  abotn

PREFACE 

this  book,  but  about  the  books  they  love.  Our  world  is  rapidly 
drawing  to  a  close  ;  a  new  one  is  about  to  open.  If  it  is  to  flourish 
it  will  have  to  rest  on  deeds  as  well  as  faith.  The  word  will  have  to 
become  flesh. 

There  are  few  among  us  today  who  are  able  to  view  the  immediate 
future  with  anything  but  fear  and  apprehension.  If  there  is  one  book 
among  all  those  I  have  recendy  read  which  I  might  signal  as  con- 
taining words  of  comfort,  peace,  inspiration  and  sublimity,  it  is 
Henry  Adams'  Mont-Saint-Michel  and  Chartrfs.  Particularly  the 
chapters  dealing  with  Chartres  and  the  cult  of  the  Virgin  Mary. 
Every  reference  to  the  "  Queen  **  is  exalted  and  commanding.  Let 
me  quote  a  passage — page  194* — which  is  in  order  : 

There  she  acttially  is — ^not  in  symbol  or  in  fancy,  but  in 
penon,  descending  on  her  errands  of  mercy  and  listening 
to  each  one  of  us,  as  her  miracles  prove,  or  satisfying  our 
prayers  merely  by  her  presence  which  calms  our  excite- 
ment as  that  of  a  mother  calms  her  child.  She  is  there  as 
Queen,  not  merely  as  intercessor,  and  her  power  is  such 
that  to  her  the  difierence  between  us  earthly  beings  is 
nothing.  Pierre  Mauclerc  and  PhiHppe  Hurepel  and  their 
men-at-arms  are  afraid  of  her,  and  the  Bishop  himself  is 
never  quite  at  his  ease  in  her  presence  ;  but  to  peasants, 
and  beggars,  and  people  in  trouble,  this  sense  of  her  power 
and  caJm  is  better  than  active  sympathy.  People  who 
sufi*er  beyond  the  formulas  of  expression — ^who  are  crushed 
into  silence,  and  beyond  pain — ^want  no  display  of  emotion 
— ^no  bleeding  heart — ^no  weeping  at  the  foot  of  the  Cross 
— ^no  hysterics — ^no  phrases  !  They  want  to  see  God,  and  to 
know  that  He  is  watching  over  His  own. 

There  are  writers,  such  as  this  man,  who  enrich  us — and  others 
who  impoverish  us.  However  it  be,  there  is  all  the  while  a  more 
important  thing  going  on.  All  the  while,  whether  we  enrich  or 
impoverish,  we  who  write,  we  authors,  we  men  of  letters,  we 
scribblers,  are  being  supported,  protected,  maintained,  enriched 
and  endowed  by  a  vast  horde  of  unknown  individuals — the  men 
and  women  who  watch  and  pray,  so  to  speak,  that  we  reveal  the 
truth  which  is  in  us.  How  vast  this  multitude  is  no  man  knows. 
No  one  artist  has  ever  reached  the  whole  great  throbbing  mass

of  humanity.  We  swim  in  the  same  stream,  we  drink  from  the 
same  source,  yet  how  often  or  how  deeply  are  we  aware,  we  who 
write,  of  the  common  need  i  If  to  write  books  is  to  restore  what 
we  have  taken  from  the  granary  of  Hfe,  from  sisters  and  brothers 
unknown,  then  I  say  :  "  Let  us  have  more  books ! " 

In  the  second  volume  of  this  work  I  shall  write,  among  other 
things,  of  Pornography  and  Obscenity,  Gilles  de  Rais,  Haggard's 
Ayesha,  Marie  CorelH,  Dostoievsky's  Grand  Inquisitor,  C^Hne, 
Maeterlinck,  Berdyaev,  Claude  Houghton  and  Malaparte.  The 
index  of  all  references  to  all  books  and  authors  cited  in  all  of  my 
books  will  be  included  in  the  second  volume.

I 


THEY  WERE  ALIVE  AND  THEY  SPOKE  TO  ME 

I  SIT  in  a  little  room,  one  wall  of  which  is  now  completely  lined 
with  books.  It  is  the  first  time  I  have  had  the  pleasure  of  working 
with  anything  like  a  collection  of  books.  There  are  probably  no 
more  than  five  hundred  in  all,  but  for  the  most  part  they  represent 
my  own  choice.  It  is  the  first  time,  since  I  began  my  writing  career, 
that  I  am  surrounded  with  a  goodly  number  of  the  books  I  have 
always  longed  to  possess.  The  fact,  however,  that  in  the  past  I 
did  most  of  my  work  without  the  aid  of  a  Hbrary  I  look  upon  as 
an  advantage  rather  than  a  disadvantage. 

One  of  the  first  things  I  associate  with  the  reading  of  books  is 
the  struggle  I  waged  to  obtain  them.  Not  to  own  them,  mind  you, 
but  to  lay  hands  on  them.  From  the  moment  the  passion  took 
hold  of  me  I  encountered  nothing  but  obstacles.  The  books  I 
wanted,  at  the  pubUc  Hbrary,  were  always  out.  And  of  course  I 
never  had  the  money  to  buy  them.  To  get  permission  from  the 
Hbrary  in  my  neighborhood — I  was  then  eighteen  or  nineteen 
years  of  age— to  borrow  such  a  **  demoralizing  "  work  as  The 
Confession  of  a  Fool,  by  Strindberg,  was  just  impossible.  In  those 
days  the  books  which  young  people  were  prohibited  from  reading 
were  decorated  with  stars — one,  two  or  three — according  to  the 
degree  of  immoraHty  attributed  to  them.  I  suspect  this  procedure 
still  obtains.  I  hope  so,  for  I  know  of  nothing  better  calculated  to 
whet  one's  appetite  than  this  stupid  sort  of  classification  and 
prohibition. 

What  makes  a  book  live  ?  How  often  this  question  arises  !  The 
answer,  in  my  opinion,  is  simple.  A  book  Hves  through  the  pas- 
sionate recommendation  of  one  reader  to  another.  Nothing  can 
throttle  this  basic  impulse  in  the  human  being.  Despite  the  views 
of  cynics  and  misanthropes,  it  is  my  beHef  that  men  will  always 
strive  to  share  their  deepest  experiences. 

Books  are  one  of  the  few  things  incn  cherish  deeply.  And  the 
32

better  the  man  the  more  easily  will  he  part  with  his  most  cherished 
possessions.  A  book  lying  idle  on  a  shelf  is  wasted  ammunirion. 
Like  money,  books  must  be  kept  in  constant  circulation.  Lend 
and  borrow  to  the  maximum — of  both  books  and  money  !  But 
especially  books,  for  books  represent  infinitely  more  than  money. 
A  book  is  not  only  a  fiiend,  it  makes  friends  for  you.  When  you 
have  possessed  a  book  with  mind  and  spirit,  you  are  enriched. 
But  when  you  pass  it  on  you  are  enriched  threefold. 

Here  an  irrepressible  impulse  seizes  me  to  offer  a  piece  of 
gratuitous  advice.  It  is  this :  read  as  Uttle  as  possible,  not  as  much 
as  possible  !  Oh,  do  not  doubt  that  I  have  envied  those  who  drowned 
themselves  in  books.  I,  too,  would  secretly  Hke  to  wade  through 
all  those  books  I  have  so  long  toyed  with  in  my  mind.  But  I  know 
it  is  not  important.  I  know  now  that  I  did  not  need  to  read  even 
a  tenth  of  what  I  have  read.  The  most  difficult  thing  in  Ufe  is  to 
learn  to  do  only  what  is  strictly  advantageous  to  one's  welfare, 
strictly  vital. 

There  is  an  excellent  way  to  test  this  precious  bit  of  advice  I  have 
not  given  rashly.  When  you  stumble  upon  a  book  you  would 
like  to  read,  or  think  you  ought  to  read,  leave  it  alone  for  a  few 
days.  But  think  about  it  as  intensely  as  you  can.  Let  the  title  and 
the  author's  name  revolve  in  your  mind.  Think  what  you  yourself 
might  have  written  had  the  opportunity  been  yours.  Ask  yourself 
earnestly  if  it  be  absolutely  necessary  to  add  this  work  to  your 
store  of  knowledge  or  your  fund  of  enjoyment.  Try  to  imagine 
what  it  would  mean  to  forego  this  extra  pleasure  or  erdightenment. 
Then,  if  you  find  you  must  read  the  book,  observe  with  what 
extraordinary  acumen  you  tackle  it.  Observe,  too,  that  however 
stimulating  it  may  be,  very  Httle  of  the  book  is  really  new  to  you. 
If  you  are  honest  with  yourself  you  will  discover  that  your  stature 
has  increased  from  the  mere  effort  of  resisting  your  impulses. 

Indubitably  the  vast  majority  of  books  overlap  one  another. 
Few  indeed  are  those  which  give  the  impression  of  originality, 
either  in  style  or  content.  Rare  are  the  unique  books — ^less  than 
fifiy,  perhaps,  out  of  the  whole  storehouse  of  Hterature.  In  one  of 
his  recent  autobiographical  novels,  Blaise  Cendrars  points  out 
that  R^my  de  Gourmont,  because  of  his  knowledge  and  awareness 
of  this  repetitive  quaUty  in  books,  was  able  to  select  and  read  all 

23 


THE    BOOKS    IN    MY    LIFE 

that  is  worth  while  in  the  entire  reahn  of  literature,  Cendrars 
himself— who  would  suspect  it  ?— is  a  prodigious  reader.  He  reads 
most  authors  in  their  original  tongue.  Not  only  that,  but  when 
he  Ukes  an  author  he  reads  every  last  book  the  man  has  written, 
as  well  as  his  letters  and  all  the  books  that  have  been  written  about 
him.  In  our  day  his  case  is  almost  unparalleled,  I  imagine.  For, 
not  only  has  he  read  widely  and  deeply,  but  he  has  himself  written 
a  great  many  books.  All  on  the  side,  as  it  were.  For,  if  he  is  any- 
thing, Cendrars,  he  is  a  man  of  action,  an  adventurer  and  explorer, 
a  man  who  has  known  how  to  "waste**  his  time  royally.  He 
is,  in  a  sense,  the  JuHus  Caesar  of  Hterature. 

The  other  day,  at  the  request  of  the  French  publisher,  Gallimard, 
I  made  up  a  Hst  of  the  hundred  books*  which  I  thought  had 
influenced  me  most.  A  strange  list,  indeed,  containing  such  incon- 
gruous titles  as  Peck*s  Bad  Boy,  Letters  from  the  Mahatmas  and  Pitcaim 
Island.  The  first  named,  a  decidedly  "  bad  "  book,  I  read  as  a  boy. 
I  thought  it  worth  including  in  my  list  because  no  other  book 
ever  made  me  laugh  so  heartily.  Later,  in  my  teens,  I  made  periodical 
trips  to  the  local  hbrary  to  paw  the  books  on  the  shelf  labelled 
"  Humor.**  How  few  I  found  which  were  really  humorous  ! 
This  is  the  one  realm  of  Uterature  which  is  woefully  meagre  and 
deficient.  After  citing  Huckleberry  Finn,  The  Crock  of  Gold,  Lysis- 
trata.  Dead  Souls,  two  or  three  of  Chesterton's  works,  and  Juno 
and  the  Paycock,  I  am  hard  put  to  it  to  mention  anything  outstanding 
in  this  category  of  humor.  There  are  passages  in  Dostoievsky  and 
in  Hamsun,  it  is  true,  which  still  bring  tean  of  laughter  to  my  eyes, 
but  they  are  only  passages.  The  professional  humorists,  and  their 
names  are  legion,  bore  me  to  death.  Books  on  humor,  such  as 
Max  Eastman*s,  Arthur  Koestler*s,  or  Bergson's,  I  also  find  deadly. 
It  would  be  an  achievement,  I  feel,  if  I  could  write  just  one  humorous 
book  before  I  die.  The  Chinese,  incidentally,  possess  a  sense  of 
humor  which  is  very  close,  very  dear,  to  me.  Particularly  their 
poets  and  philosophers.
